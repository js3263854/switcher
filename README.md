D-Link DSP-W215 Switcher Relay Software For Linux

Allows you to control your switch with a click of a button.
You might have to edit the user,pass,ip and reopen the software before it works.

Still some bugs that need ironing out obviously. You will need certain libs including curl, pugixml, openssl, libc++std etc

Hope it helps, I found it useful so I hope you do too.

Many thanks to @bikerp for detailed authentication process, @LinuxChristian for pyW215 python scripts which this software is based.
